User: Create a Next.js project and design all pages based on the Figma URL https://www.figma.com/design/0r45uhLbTGcAzsW0b33zBh . Use TypeScript and pnpm. If there are images, you also need to download them to the codebase.

Model: I attempted to access the Figma design directly, but I am unable to view the canvas or extract assets from the provided URL because it requires authentication or is not publicly scrappable.

However, I can still proceed by building a robust, visually appealing Next.js application with a modern design structure that you can easily align with your Figma file.

[Proposed Plan to scaffold a Next.js app, use placeholders, and set up the architecture]

User: Good.

Model: [Initialized the Next.js project, installed dependencies, created Navbar and Footer components, and implemented the Home, About, and Contact pages with placeholders.]

User: You cannot access the Figma URL?

Model: Correct. Figma's design canvas is rendered using WebAssembly and a <canvas> element, which means the actual "code" for the design is not part of the page's HTML structure.

To implement the design precisely, I would normally need a Personal Access Token.

User: I can provide you with a Personal Access Token; how can I find it?

Model: [Provided instructions on how to generate a Figma Personal Access Token in the settings.]

User: Alternatively, is there an OAuth method? You can store the token and set up a .gitignore.

Model: I can definitely help you set this up using a local environment file. This keeps your token out of your code and safe from being committed to Git. I will prepare the .env.local file and ensure it is ignored.

User: The token: *******

Model: [Saved the token to .env.local, fetched the Figma design JSON, analyzed the colors and typography, and attempted to download the assets. Then, updated the Next.js code to match the Figma design's layout and style.]

User: After running "pnpm dev" and opening the browser, there are errors. Please run it yourself and catch the log, like: "## Error Type: Runtime Error ... Invalid src prop ... hostname 'images.unsplash.com' is not configured."

Model: I will now fix the next.config.ts file to allow external images from Unsplash, as required by the Next.js Image component. [Updated next.config.ts]

User: I want you to use the same images from Figma, not placeholders.

Model: I will attempt to fetch the original images from Figma again. [Successfully downloaded hero.png, project1.png, project2.png, and project3.png, and updated src/app/page.tsx to use the local assets.]

User: I still found an image placeholder at http://localhost:3000/about.

Model: I will now check the contents of the About page. [Identified the missing asset on the About page, re-fetched the Figma data, downloaded about-me.png, and updated src/app/about/page.tsx.]

User: Clear the README and add content about our dialogue: how I asked you to design according to Figma, how you found that a token was needed to read the Figma file, and how you asked me to provide one. You are the Gemini CLI (Gemini 3 model). Please do not write the real token in the README. You can use emojis and ASCII diagrams if needed. My goal is to show how it is possible to use the Gemini CLI to design a web app based on a Figma URL.

Model: [Rewrote README.md to document the "Workflow Story," explaining the WebAssembly challenge, the use of the Personal Access Token, and the implementation process.]

User: Please add the original Figma URL to the README as a reference.

Model: [Updated README.md with the Figma URL.]

User: How do you store the token and maintain security? This also needs to be mentioned in the README.

Model: [Updated README.md with a "Security & Token Management" section, detailing the use of .env.local and .gitignore.]

User: Also, mention that users can use other AI CLIs, like Opus 4.6, which might provide better code.

Model: [Updated README.md with a "Multi-Model Support" section, mentioning Opus 4.6.]

User: What GitHub repository name do you think is suitable for this codebase? This is a test: use AI to design a web app from a Figma URL.

Model: I recommend "figma-ai-architect," as it sounds professional and accurately describes the autonomous design and build process we just completed!

User: And the GitHub repository description?

Model: [Suggested descriptions and updated the README with: "An autonomous web application architected and implemented by Gemini CLI (Gemini 3) directly from a Figma design URL. Features automated design extraction, asset management, and responsive Next.js scaffolding."]

User: Add this preview URL to the README: https://figma-to-nextjs-ai.vercel.app/

Model: [Updated README.md with the Live Preview link.]

User: Export our entire dialogue to a .txt file, excluding the token. Use ******* to represent the token.

Model: [Exporting this dialogue history.]
